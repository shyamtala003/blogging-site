## Project Description

Developed a fully functional and responsive blogging website using MERN stack, hosted on Render.com for back-end and Vercel for front-end. Implemented features allowing users to write, edit,delete, and share their blog posts, as well as add high-quality images to their content using Cloudinary and Multer for image uploading at the back-end. User input was gathered using React Quill, a rich text editor, to allow bloggers to create content in a more user-friendly format. Password encryption using bcryptjs and user authentication through JSON Web Tokens (JWT) was also implemented for secure user access. Built using React.js and pure CSS for a modern and sleek design.

<br />

## Key skills and technologies used:

- MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node.js)
  Render.com and Vercel for hosting
- Cloudinary and Multer for image uploading at the backend
- React Quill for user input
- bcrypt.js for password encryption
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication
- React.js and pure CSS for front-end development
- Responsive design and user-friendly interface implementation
